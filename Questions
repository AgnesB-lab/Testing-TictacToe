Before answering the homework questions, I would like to say, that I couldn't run any test, because it just didn't work. I don't know where I am wrong, but nothing worked. And I spent a few hours on it... I feel totally lost with this testing issue and also a little bit with github, because the commit function doesn't always work..
a) What is a Python module and how does it differ from a Python package?
A python module is  a kind of toolbox containing tools with predefined functions. This tools are ordered in kind of families or collections which can be called packages because they deal with the same theme.
b) What are side effects and give some examples.
A side effect is a result of an visible action executed by a module, when something is being printed, a question is being  asked to the user, a text appears...
c) What are Exceptions and what to do if third-party code that we use throws them?
Exceptions are a way of categorizing different use-cases, depending on the context and errors that can occur. They are ordered in families, classes and point to apparented error types. It is a good orientation to better understand where the encountered issue is coming from. I don't understand what third-party code means).
d)Using which keywords can you create, throw and catch your new custom Exception?
Python provides a hierarchy of standard exceptions and looking in the Python documentation helps you create, throw and catch your own created exception.
e) Give examples of some benefits of testing?
Testing is like verifying step by step that your code is working well: it improves the end quality of the code and spares you from bad last minutes surprises: it can also be cost-effective, enhance the performance of your code. If you test it regularly, you are sure it works safely, properly. It will be very reliable for the end-user, who will feel secure using the product and be very satisfied.###
